# Python HamQTH

A [HamQTH] client library for Python.

> HamQTH provides a simple interface for application developers.

This library supports the [XML callbook search](https://www.hamqth.com/developers.php#xml_search) which provides search capability for:

 - callsign data
 - callsign bio
 - recent activity of any callsign

Usage requires [registration](https://www.hamqth.com/register.php) with the HamQTH service.

## Installation and Usage

For more detailed information check out the [Project Documentation] on GitHub Pages. Also check out the code and tests as the source of truth.

Requests is also required, you made need to install it separately.

```shell
pip install hamqth
```

```python
>>> from hamqth import HamQTHClient
>>> client = HamQTHClient()
>>> client.authenticate('username', 'password')
>>> client.search_callsign('callsign')
â€¦
>>> client.logout()
```
